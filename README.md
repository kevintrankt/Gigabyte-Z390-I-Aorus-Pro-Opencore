# Gigabyte-Z390-I-Aorus-Pro-Opencore

This is my Opencore setup for the Gigabyte Z390 I Aorus Pro ITX motherboard. **This should be used as a reference**; there is no guarantee that my set up will work for yours even if you have the same hardware. This was originally a Clover build, but I converted to Opencore because I was tired of having to update so many things for each macOS update with Clover.
