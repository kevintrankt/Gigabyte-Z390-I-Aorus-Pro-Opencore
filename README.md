# Gigabyte-Z390-I-Aorus-Pro-Opencore

This is my Opencore setup for the Gigabyte Z390 I Aorus Pro ITX motherboard. **This should be used as a reference**; there is no guarantee that my set up will work for yours even if you have the same hardware. This was originally a Clover build, but I converted to Opencore because I was tired of having to update so many things for each macOS update with Clover.

Currently using prebuilt SSDTs. I plan on compiling my own when I have the time.

### Process
1. Follow [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) for Coffee Lake builds.
2. Ensure `AppleXcpmCfgLock` and `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` are enabled under `Kernel -> Quirks` in order for Opencore to boot into your installation media.
3. Follow [this doc ](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/security.html) to enable FileVault. `AuthRestart`, `UIScale`, `HashServices`, and `ExitBootServicesDelay` unchanged.
